This project is to help me learn more about C#. It's a basic command-line game (for now) that allows a user to compete against an "AI" that uses basic int generator to assign rock, paper, scissors.

Features currently included:

- 1 player vs 1 computer
- Replayability

Features to come:

- Connectivity of 2 players
- Track number of wins and losses at end of single instance
- App featuring a chat

If anyone has any ideas or questions please reach out to me:
